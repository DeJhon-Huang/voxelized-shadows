This subdirectory contains the Unity scene that was exported to the main application.

This is not part of the main application but was included in this subdirectory for completeness.


## Construction

The scene was created using the following software:

- Unity 5.6
- Autodesk Maya
- Allegorithmic Substance Designer

Unity was used to assemble the scene as it allowed fast construction in a visual editor and supports custom scripts to export content.

## Exporting

The script that exported the scene can be found in the Assets/Editor/ subdirectory. It can be run by selecting Custom->Export Scene from the menu at the top of the Unity editor.

The scene is exported to the Meshes, Textures and Scenes directories in the root of the project as a series of text and .png files.

## How To View

Note: The scene is identical to the one in the main application and can be viewed there without downloading Unity.

- Download Unity 5.6 or later from https://unity3d.com/
- Open Unity and select the Assets folder from the Open Project dialog
- Double-click on the scene in the Project panel
